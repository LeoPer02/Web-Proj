# Web-Proj

**
This is a project created during university in order to learn about JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Servers.
The project was made to be ran locally and it isn't a responsive website (Most animations and layouts will bug when changing the screen size, mainly mobile screens).
**
**
The server assumes the existance of a mysql database called "inv", with the tables "employees", "items" and "expenses". The required atributes for this tables can be found in the modules file.
Also both the username and password for the database are hardcoded user:"web_db" pass:"P@ssword123".
**

**
In order to avoid storing all images in the mysql database, all background, items and employees images are stored in the public folder. In the items tables, the "img" atribute requires a path to the the folder containing the images.
**



**
The database and images (except background images) will not be provided, therefore there will be the need to create the database yourself and insert the items yourself.
**

**
The Project was in no way made in order to be used but rather as a away to get introduced to web developing, therefore do not expect it to be secure.
