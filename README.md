# Web-Proj

This is a project created during university in order to learn about JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Servers.
The project was made to be ran locally and it isn't a responsive website (Most animations and layouts will bug when changing the screen size, mainly mobile screens).

The server assumes the existance of a mysql database called "inv", with the tables "employees", "items" and "expenses". The required atributes for this tables can be found in the modules file.
Also both the username and password for the database are hardcoded user:"web_db" pass:"P@ssword123".
